Check if given string is a rotated palindrome or not
Given a string, check if it is a rotated palindrome or not.

 

For example,
CBAABCD is a rotated palindrome as it is rotation of palindrome ABCDCBA
BAABCC is a rotated palindrome as it is rotation of palindrome ABCCBA
 

 
Naive solution would be to consider all rotations of the given string and check if any rotation is a palindrome or not. If we have found a rotation that is a palindrome, we return true else we return false.
