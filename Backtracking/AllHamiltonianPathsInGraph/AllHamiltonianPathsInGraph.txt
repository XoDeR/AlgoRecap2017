Print All Hamiltonian Path present in a graph
Given an undirected graph, print all Hamiltonian paths present in it. Hamiltonian path is a path in an undirected or directed graph that visits each vertex exactly once.

The idea is to use backtracking. We check if every edge starting from an unvisited vertex leads to a solution or not. As Hamiltonian path visits each vertex exactly once, we take help of visited[] array in proposed solution to process only unvisited vertices. Also we use path[] array to stores vertices covered in current path. If all the vertices are visited, then Hamiltonian path exists in the graph and we print the complete path stored in path[] array.
