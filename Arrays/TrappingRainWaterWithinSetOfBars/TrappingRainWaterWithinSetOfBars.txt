Find maximum amount of water that can be trapped within given set of bars. Assume width of each bar is 1 unit.

 
For example,
Input: Array containing height of bars {7, 0, 4, 2, 5, 0, 6, 4, 0, 5}

  rain water trapping bars

Maximum amount of water that can be trapped is 25 as shown below (in blue color).

The idea is to calculate maximum height bar on the left and right of every bar. Then the amount of water that can be stored on top of each bar is equal to minimum among maximum bar to the left and right minus height of current bar.

Output: 

Maximum amount of water that can be trapped is 25

 
The time complexity of above solution is O(n) and auxiliary space used by the program is O(n).

Output: 

Maximum amount of water that can be trapped is 25

 
The time complexity of above solution is O(n) and auxiliary space used by the program is O(1).
