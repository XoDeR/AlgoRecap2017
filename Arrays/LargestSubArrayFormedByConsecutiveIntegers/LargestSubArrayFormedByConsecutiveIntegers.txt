Find largest sub-array formed by consecutive integers
Given an array of integers, find largest sub-array formed by consecutive integers. The sub-array should contain all distinct values.

 

For example,

Input:  { 2, 0, 2, 1, 4, 3, 1, 0 }
Output: The largest sub-array is { 0, 2, 1, 4, 3 }

 

 
The idea is to consider every sub-array and keep track of largest subarray found so far which is formed by consecutive integers. In order for an sub-array to contain consecutive integers,
The difference between maximum and minimum element in it should be exactly equal to length of the subarray minus one.
 
All elements in the array should be distinct (we can check this by inserting the elements in set or using a visited array).

Output: 

The largest sub-array is [1, 5]

 
The time complexity of above solution is O(n3) and auxiliary space used by the program is O(n).
