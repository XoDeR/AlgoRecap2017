Find maximum product of two integers in an array
Given an array of integers, find maximum product of two integers in an array.

For example, consider array {-10, -3, 5, 6, -2}
Maximum product is formed by (-10, -3) or (5, 6) pair.

Naive solution would be to consider every pair of elements and calculate their product. We update maximum product found so far if the product of current pair is greater. Finally, we print the elements involved in maximum product.

Output: 

Pair is (-10, -3)

 
The time complexity of above solution is O(n2) and auxiliary space used by the program is O(1).
 
 
Time complexity can be improved by sorting the array. Then the maximum product is formed by maximum of

product of maximum and second maximum integer in the array which are last two elements in sorted array.
product of minimum and second minimum integer in the array which are first two elements in sorted array

Output: 

Pair is (-10, -3)

 
The time complexity of above solution is O(nlogn) and auxiliary space used by the program is O(1).
 
 
We can solve this problem in linear time as we need only maximum, second maximum, minimum and second minimum element to solve this problem. We can compute all these in only single traversal of the array which accounts for O(n) time complexity.

Output: 

Pair is (-10, -3)
