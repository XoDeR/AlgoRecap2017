Given an undirected or a directed graph, implement the graph using any data structure provided by any programming language library (e.g. STL in C++ or Collections in Java, etc). Implement for both weighted and unweighted graphs.




we will implement graph using its Adjacency List representation without using any container provided by standard library.
As we already know that adjacency list associates each vertex in the graph with the collection of its neighboring vertices or edges i.e every vertex stores a list of adjacent vertices. There are many variations of adjacency list representation depending upon the implementation. 
For example, for above graph below is its Adjacency List pictorial representation –

Above representation allows the storage of additional data on the vertices but practically very efficient when the graph contains only few edges. We will use STL vectors to implement Adjacency List representation of a graph.
STL implementation of an Unweigted Graph –

Output: 

0 –> 1
1 –> 2
2 –> 0 1
3 –> 2
4 –> 5
5 –> 4

STL implementation for Weighted Graphs –
  

Output: 

(0, 1, 6)
(1, 2, 7)
(2, 0, 5) (2, 1, 4)
(3, 2, 10)
(4, 5, 1)
(5, 4, 3)
